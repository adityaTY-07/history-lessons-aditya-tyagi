🚀 My First History Website (Histori-fi)
This is a practice website I built for a history learning platform called "Histori-fi". It's a project to learn and practice pure HTML and CSS.

It's not a real company, just a demo to show what's possible with only these two languages!

💻 What's Inside?
This project has 3 main parts:

index.html - This is the main homepage. It has a header, a "hero" section, and a grid of course cards.

lesson-rome.html - This is the lesson page for a single course. I used "The Roman Republic" as an example. It has a main article area and a sidebar.

style.css - This one file holds all the styles for the entire website. It controls the colors, fonts, layout, and even the responsive design for mobile.

🏃 How to Run This Website
You don't need any special software or a web server. It runs right from your computer.

Make sure all three files (index.html, lesson-rome.html, and style.css) are in the same folder.

Go into that folder on your computer.

Double-click on the index.html file.

It will open directly in your web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge). You can then click the "Continue Lesson" button on the "Roman Republic" card to visit the lesson page.

Important: Don't just open the folder in your browser, or you'll just see a list of files (like index.html and style.css). You have to open the index.html file itself!

🛠️ Technologies Used
This project was built using only these two technologies.

HTML5: Used for all the structure, text, links, and content.

CSS3: Used for all the styling, layout, colors, and fonts.

This includes CSS Variables, Flexbox, and Grid to create the modern layout.
